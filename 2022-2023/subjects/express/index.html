**You will need**

- [Node.js][node] 18+
- [Google Chrome][chrome] (recommended, any browser with developer tools will do)
- [Postman][postman] (recommended, any tool that makes raw HTTP requests will do)

**Recommended reading**

- [npm](../npm/)
- [RESTful APIs](../rest/)

Express is **minimalist**: it doesn't provide much out of the box.
Use the many **middleware** packages at your disposal to build more complex applications.


]
---
### Install the Express generator

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a> > <a href="#2">What is Express?</a>]

You can create an Express app from scratch, but we'll use a [custom generator][generator-express-api-es] to quickly create an application skeleton:

```bash
$> npm install -g yo
$> npm install -g generator-express-api-es
```

It provides the `express-api-es` [Yeoman][yeoman] generator.

---
### Generate a skeleton application

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a> > <a href="#2">What is Express?</a>]

Run the generator and follow the prompts. Here we will use the default `express-api` project name.

```bash
$> yo express-api-es
create express-api/app.js
create express-api/bin/start.js
create express-api/package.json
create express-api/routes/index.js
create express-api/routes/users.js
info Installing npm packages
Your express app has been generated.
You can start it by entering the following commands:
cd express-api
DEBUG=express-api:* npm start
```

---
### Run the app

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a> > <a href="#2">What is Express?</a>]

```bash
$> cd express-api
$> DEBUG=express-api:* npm start

> express-api@0.1.0 start
> node ./bin/start

  express-api:server Listening on port 3000 +0ms
```

---
### Browse the landing page

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a> > <a href="#2">What is Express?</a>]

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser and you should see the app running:

<p class="center">
  <img src="images/express-running.png" width="100%" />
</p>;


In the CLI where you're running the app, you should also see that your request was **logged**:

```txt
  express-api:server Listening on port 3000 +0ms
GET / 200 2.050 ms - 17
```

## Application structure

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a>]



<img src="images/structure.jpg" class="w70" />

What goes where

---
### The server component

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a> > <a href="#8">Application structure</a>]

Let's take a look at the generated files:

```txt
package.json
app.js
routes
  index.js
  users.js
bin
  start.js
```

- `package.json` is used to track **dependencies** with npm
- `app.js` is the **main script** that will create and configure the Express app
- `routes` contains files that define the app's **routes and controllers**
- `bin/start.js` is the **entrypoint** (the script you execute to launch the app)

The above files are executed **locally** on your machine when you develop,
or **on the server** when you deploy to a host.

---
### The package.json file

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a> > <a href="#8">Application structure</a>]

Let's take a look at the generated `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "express-api",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node ./bin/start"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "cookie-parser": "~1.4.4",
    "debug": "~2.6.9",
    "express": "~4.16.1",
    "http-errors": "~1.6.3",
    "morgan": "~1.9.1"
  }
}

```

- There is a **start script** configured to launch the app with `npm start`
- A few **dependencies** are pre-installed to provide basic web app functionality

## Live reload

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a>]



<p class="center">
  <img src="images/nodemon.png" class="w70" />
</p>;

---
### Not having to restart manually

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a> > <a href="#11">Live reload</a>]

> Unlike PHP with Apache, Node.js source code is not reinterpreted on-the-fly
> after you make modifications. Once it is loaded into memory, updating the
> source code has no effect.

[Nodemon][nodemon] is a **monitoring script** that can launch any Node.js app
for you, and **automatically restart it** when you make changes.

It's an npm package you can install globally:

```bash
$> npm install -g nodemon
$> cd /path/to/projects/express-api
$> DEBUG=express-api:* nodemon
[nodemon] 2.0.19
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] `watching path(s): *.*`
[nodemon] watching extensions: js,mjs,json
[nodemon] `starting node ./bin/start`
  express-api:server Listening on port 3000 +0ms
```

It will execute the `npm start` script defined in your `package.json` by default,
and restart the app if **any file changes**.

---
### Adding nodemon as a development dependency

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a> > <a href="#11">Live reload</a>]

Instead of installing it globally, it's good practice to install nodemon as a **development dependency** so that your whole team can use it without having to re-install it globally on their machine:

```bash
$> cd /path/to/projects/express-api
$> npm install --save-dev nodemon
```

Add an npm run script called `dev` in your `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "name": "express-api",
  "scripts": {
*   "dev": "nodemon",
    "start": "node ./bin/www"
  },
  ...
}
```

If you commit this change, anyone cloning your repository can run nodemon (after running `npm install`):

```bash
$> npm run dev
```

---
### Making nodemon faster

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a> > <a href="#11">Live reload</a>]

Nodemon watches **all file changes** by default; this consumes extra CPU time
and memory. You can make it watch **only relevant files** by adding a
`nodemon.json` configuration file in your project's directory:

```json
{
    "watch": [
      "app.js",
      "bin/start.js",
      "roujtes/**/*"
    ]
}
```

If you add **new directories** containing source code to your project, **do not
forget** to add them to this configuration file for nodemon to watch them as
well.

## Express middleware

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a>]



Handling requests and responses

---
### What is middleware?

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a> > <a href="#15">Express middleware</a>]

Middlewares are functions that are called **during the application's request-response cycle**.
They can:

- Execute any code
- Make changes to the request and the response objects
- End the request-response cycle
- Call the next middleware in the chain

---
### Middleware function signature

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a> > <a href="#15">Express middleware</a>]

This is an example of a middleware function:

```js
function myMiddleware(req, res, next) {
  console.log("Hello World!");
  next();
}
```

Whenever a request is made to the Express application, it will receive:

- The current **request** object (HTTP method, path, headers, etc)
- The **response** object (can be used to configure and send the response)
- A `next()` function that **calls the next middleware**

So, middlewares form a **chain** and are executed **in order, one by one**.

---
### Plug in middleware functions

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a> > <a href="#15">Express middleware</a>]

Open `app.js`:

```js
const app = express();

app.use(logger("dev"));
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
app.use(cookieParser());

app.use("/", indexRouter);
app.use("/users", usersRouter);
```

Middleware functions are **plugged into your application** by passing them to `app.use()`.
As you can see, several middlewares are already plugged in.

---
### Add your own

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a> > <a href="#15">Express middleware</a>]

Add your new middleware function just below the creation of the Express application:

```js
const app = express();

app.use(function myMiddleware(req, res, next) {
  console.log("Hello World!");
  next();
});
```

In your CLI, stop the running application with Ctrl-C, restart it, and reload the page in your browser.
You should see your middleware working:

```bash
express-api:server Listening on port 3000 +0ms
GET / 304 287.312 ms - -
Hello World
```

---
### Limiting middleware by HTTP method or URL path

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a> > <a href="#15">Express middleware</a>]

You can use a middleware only for HTTP requests on a specific path:

```js
app.use("/hello", function hello(req, res, next) {
  res.send("world");
});
```

Express also provides `.get`, `.post`, `.put`, etc to apply a middleware only for requests made with that HTTP method:

```js
app.post("/ping", function ping(req, res, next) {
  res.send("pong");
});
```

As you can see, you can use `res.send()` to send a response to the client.

---
### Controlling the middleware chain

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a> > <a href="#15">Express middleware</a>]

Remove the call to `next()` in your first middleware function:

```js
app.use(function myMiddleware(req, res, next) {
  console.log("Hello World!");
});
```

Again, restart the app and reload the page in your browser.

The page is not loading... Why?

---
#### Sending a response

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a> > <a href="#15">Express middleware</a> > <a href="#21">Controlling the middleware chain</a>]

By not calling `next()`, you have **interrupted the middleware chain**:
the next middleware functions are not being executed, so no response is being sent to the client.

Update your middleware again, this time to send a response to the client:

```js
app.use(function myMiddleware(req, res, next) {
  console.log("Hello World!");
  res.send("Hello World!");
});
```

If you restart the app and reload the page in your browser, you will see that it works again.

But you're still not calling next, so all you see is the Hello World response.
**Other** middleware functions are **still not executed**.

---
#### Calling next again

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a> > <a href="#15">Express middleware</a> > <a href="#21">Controlling the middleware chain</a>]

Put the call to `next()` back in:

```js
app.use(function myMiddleware(req, res, next) {
  console.log("Hello World!");
  res.send("Hello World!");
  next();
});
```

Now there's an error... Why?

```bash
  express-api:server Listening on port 3000 +0ms
Hello World!
GET / 304 - ms - -
Error [ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT]:
  Cannot set headers after they are sent to the client
    at ServerResponse.setHeader (_http_outgoing.js:455:11)
    at ServerResponse.header (.../express/lib/response.js:767:10)
    at ServerResponse.contentType (.../express/lib/response.js:595:15)
    at ServerResponse.send (.../express/lib/response.js:145:14)
    ...
```

---
#### Only one response can be sent

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a> > <a href="#15">Express middleware</a> > <a href="#21">Controlling the middleware chain</a>]

This is what happens:

- Your middleware function sends the Hello World response
- Another middleware a few lines below (`app.use("/", index);`) tries to send the index page

HTTP is a request-response protocol: **one request** will get **one response**.
Your code is trying to send _two responses for the same request_.

Remember that each middleware function can either:

- Modify the request/response and pass them along to the **next middleware** in the chain
- **OR send the response** to the client and interrupt the chain

This is an application of the [chain of responsibility][design-pattern-cor] design pattern.
Each middleware decides whether to handle the request and stop the chain, or pass it along.

---
#### Serving the index page

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a> > <a href="#15">Express middleware</a> > <a href="#21">Controlling the middleware chain</a>]

Let's look at a few examples:

```http
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3000
```

<img src="images/middleware-chain-1.png" width="100%" />

---
#### Serving static files

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a> > <a href="#15">Express middleware</a> > <a href="#21">Controlling the middleware chain</a>]

```http
GET /stylesheets/style.css HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3000
```

<img src="images/middleware-chain-2.png" width="100%" />

---
#### Creating a user with a JSON payload

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a> > <a href="#15">Express middleware</a> > <a href="#21">Controlling the middleware chain</a>]

```http
POST /users HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Host: localhost:3000

{
  "name": "jdoe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

<img src="images/middleware-chain-3.png" width="100%" />

---
### Attaching data to the request in a middleware

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a> > <a href="#15">Express middleware</a>]

You can attach data to the request object:

```js
app.use(function (req, res, next) {
  req.hello = "World";
  next();
});
```

Then use that in the next middleware:

```js
app.use(function (req, res, next) {
  console.log("Hello " + req.hello); // "Hello World"
  next();
});
```

Many middlewares use this pattern to **provide data to the next middlewares**.
For example, the `express.json()` middleware parses the body of HTTP requests with the `application/json` content type,
and attaches it to the `req.body` property.

---
### Asynchronous middleware

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a> > <a href="#15">Express middleware</a>]

You don't have to call `next()` right away.
You can do it after some asynchronous calls:

```js
app.use(function(req, res, next) {
  `fs.readFile`("data.txt", "utf-8", `function(err, data)` {
  if (err) {
      return next(err);
    }
    req.myData = data;
    `next();
  }`);
});
```

The middleware chain will not proceed until you call `next()`.

---
#### Using promises

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a> > <a href="#15">Express middleware</a> > <a href="#29">Asynchronous middleware</a>]

If your asynchronous call returns a promise, you can also use `async/await`:

```js
app.use(`async function`(req, res, next) {
  try {
    req.myData = `await fs.promises.readFile`("data.txt", "utf-8");
    `next();`
  } catch (err) {
    next(err);
  }
});
```

---
### How to deal with errors in middlewares

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a> > <a href="#15">Express middleware</a>]

Sometimes things go wrong:

- The user sends invalid data
- A database query fails (invalid query, connection issue, etc)

In that case, the proper thing to do with Express is to give the error to `next()`:

```js
app.use(function(req, res, next) {
  fs.readFile("data.txt", { encoding: "utf-8" }, function(err, data) {
*   if (err) {
*     return next(err);
*   }

    req.myData = data;
    next();
  });
});
```

---
#### Error-handling with promises

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a> > <a href="#15">Express middleware</a> > <a href="#31">How to deal with errors in middlewares</a>]

If you are using `async/await`, remember to wrap your code in a `try/catch` to
catch any error that might occur, and give it to Express:

```js
app.use(async function(req, res, next) {
* try {
    req.myData = await fs.promises.readFile("data.txt", "utf-8");
    next();
* } catch (err) {
*   next(err);
* }
});
```

---
#### Error-handling middleware

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a> > <a href="#15">Express middleware</a> > <a href="#31">How to deal with errors in middlewares</a>]

When you pass an error to `next()`, the following "normal" middleware functions are **not called**.
Only special **error-handling middleware functions** are called.

Compared to normal middleware functions, an error-handling middleware takes a fourth argument (the error):

```js
app.use(function (err, req, res, next) {
  res.send("Your request failed because: " + err.message);
});
```

Simply declaring the function with these 4 arguments tells Express that this is an error-handling middleware function and not a normal one.

---
#### Error-handling example

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a> > <a href="#15">Express middleware</a> > <a href="#31">How to deal with errors in middlewares</a>]

As you can see in this example, when an error occurs in the first middleware,
other normal middlewares are **bypassed** until an **error-handling middleware** is found.

```http
POST /users HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Host: localhost:3000

{
  "name": "bourne,
  JSON BOURNE IS DEAD
}
```

<img src='images/middleware-chain-4-error-handling.png' width='100%' />

---
#### Error-handling middleware in the generated application

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a> > <a href="#15">Express middleware</a> > <a href="#31">How to deal with errors in middlewares</a>]

Take a look at `app.js`.
One error-handling middleware has already been plugged in for you:

```js
// error handler
app.use(function (err, req, res, next) {
  // set locals, only providing error in development
  res.locals.message = err.message;
  res.locals.error = req.app.get("env") === "development" ? err : {};

  // render the error page
  res.status(err.status || 500);
  res.render("error");
});
```

It will render any error in a "pretty" error page.

## The request object

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a>]



Using the `req` object

---
### Request example

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a> > <a href="#36">The request object</a>]

How can we extract all the data from this request?

```http
POST /test/a/b?page=3&select=foo&select=bar HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Host: localhost:3000
Authorization: Basic Zm9vOmJhcgo=

{
  "age": "24",
  "name": {
    "first": "John",
    "last": "Doe"
  }
}
```

---
### Getting the HTTP method, URL path and query parameters

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a> > <a href="#36">The request object</a>]

Let's start with the request line:

```http
POST /test/a/b?page=3&select=foo&select=bar HTTP/1.1
```

This is how to get the different parts:

```js
app.all("/test/:param1/:param2", function (req, res, next) {
  console.log(req.method); // "POST"
  console.log(req.path); // "/test/a/b"
  console.log(req.params); // { param1: "a", param2: "b" }
  console.log(req.query); // { page: 3, select: [ "foo", "bar" ] }
  next();
});
```

---
### Getting HTTP headers

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a> > <a href="#36">The request object</a>]

Now let's get the headers:

```http
Content-Type: application/json
Host: localhost:3000
Authorization: Basic Zm9vOmJhcgo=
```

You can get the **normalized** headers (all in lower case):

```js
app.all("/test/:param1/:param2", function (req, res, next) {
  console.log(req.headers);
  // {
  //   "content-type": "application/json",
  //   "host": "localhost:3000",
  //   "authorization": "Basic Zm9vOmJhcgo="
  // }
});
```

Or you can use `req.get()` to retrieve them in a case-insensitive manner:

```js
app.all("/test/:param1/:param2", function (req, res, next) {
  console.log(req.get("content-type")); // "application/json"
  console.log(req.get("Content-Type")); // "application/json"
});
```

---
### Getting the HTTP request body

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a> > <a href="#36">The request object</a>]

Finally, let's get the request body:

```json
{
  "age": "24",
  "name": {
    "first": "John",
    "last": "Doe"
  }
}
```

As long as you have the `express.json()` middleware in your chain, it's as simple as this:

```js
app.all("/test/:param1/:param2", function (req, res, next) {
  console.log(req.body);
  // {
  //   "age": "24",
  //   "name": {
  //     "first": "John",
  //     "last": "Doe"
  //   }
  // }
});
```

---
class: center, middle
## The response object

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a>]



Using the `res` object

---
### Sending the response

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a> > <a href="#41">The response object</a>]

Use `res.send()` for most use cases.
It will automatically determine the type of content your are sending and set the appropriate `Content-Type` header:

.grid-45[

```js
res.send("Some text");
```


]
.grid-55[

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html

Some text
```


]
.container[

.grid-45[

```js
res.send({
  some: "object",
});
```


]
.grid-55[

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "some": "object"
}
```


]

]
.container[

.grid-45[

```js
res.send(Buffer.from("0101"));
```


]
.grid-55[

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/octet-stream

0101
```


]

]
---
### Setting the HTTP status code

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a> > <a href="#41">The response object</a>]

Use `res.status()` to set the status code:

.grid-50[

```js
res.status(201).send({
  some: "object",
});
```


]
.grid-50[

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "some": "object"
}
```


]
.container[

If you have no body to send, use `res.sendStatus()`:

.grid-50[

```js
res.sendStatus(204);
```


]
.grid-50[

```http
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
```


]

]
---
### Sending HTTP response headers

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a> > <a href="#41">The response object</a>]

Use `res.set()` to set headers:

.grid-50[

```js
res.set("Header-1", "foo");
res.set("Total-Books", 2);

res.send(["Catch-22", "Fahrenheit 451"]);
```


]
.grid-50[

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Header-1: foo
Total-Books: 2

[
  "Catch-22",
  "Fahrenheit 451"
]
```


]
.container[

Setting headers does not send the response, so you can do it in **multiple middlewares** as long as you do not call `res.send()`:

.grid-50[

```js
app.use(function (req, res, next) {
  res.set("Header-1", "foo");
  next();
});

app.use(function (req, res, next) {
  res.set("Header-2", "bar");
  res.send("Some text");
});
```


]
.grid-50[

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain
Header-1: foo
Header-2: bar

Some text
```


]

]
---
### Chain response methods

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a> > <a href="#41">The response object</a>]

You can also chain all the previous methods together:

.grid-50[

```js
res.set("Header-1", "foo").status(201).send("Some text");
```


]
.grid-50[

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: text/plain
Header-1: foo

Some text
```

## Routing

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a>]



Mapping HTTP methods and URLs to handler functions

---
### Basic routing

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a> > <a href="#46">Routing</a>]

As we've seen, basic routing can be applied to middleware by using `.get`, `.post`, etc and passing a path:

```js
app.get("/hello", function () {
  res.send("World");
});
```

You can also have dynamic parameters in your URLs:

```js
app.get("/authors/`:authorId`/books/`:bookId`", function (req, res, next) {
  res.send(
    "Getting book " + `req.params.bookId` + " by " + `req.params.authorId`
  );
});
```

Calling `http://localhost:3000/authors/24/books/33` will produce the following response:

```txt
Getting book 33 by 24
```

---
### Routing middlewares

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a> > <a href="#46">Routing</a>]

A route can also contain **its own chain of successive middlewares**:

```js
function `getNameFromQuery`(req, res, next) {
  req.nameToSalute = req.query.name;
  next();
}

function `prepareSalutation`(req, res, next) {
  req.salutation = "Hello " + req.nameToSalute;
  next();
}

app.get(
  "/hello",`getNameFromQuery`,`prepareSalutation`, function (req, res, next) {
    res.send(req.salutation);
  });
```

These middleware functions are **only executed for that route** (`GET /hello` in this case).

---
### Routers

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a> > <a href="#46">Routing</a>]

An Express [router][router] is an **isolated instance of middleware and routes**.
It's basically a **mini-app**.

Imagine that you have the following API routes:

.grid-50[

```
GET /authors
POST /authors
GET /authors/:id
PATCH /authors/:id
DELETE /authors/:id
```


]
.grid-50[

```
GET /books
POST /books
GET /books/:id
PATCH /books/:id
DELETE /books/:id
```


]
.container[

You can define a **router** in a separate file for each of the two sets of routes,
that way you don't have one monolithic file with all your code in it.

#### Creating a router

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a> > <a href="#46">Routing</a> > <a href="#49">Routers</a>]

```js
import express from "express";
const booksRouter = express.Router();

booksRouter.`post("/"` /*...*/);

booksRouter.`get("/"`, function (req, res, next) {
  const books = ["Catch-22", "Fahrenheit 451"];
  res.send(books);
});

booksRouter.`get("/:id"`, function (req, res, next) {
  const book = { title: "Fahrenheit 451", year: 1953, author: "Ray Bradburry" };
  res.send(book);
});

booksRouter.`put("/:id"` /*...*/);
booksRouter.`delete("/:id"` /*...*/);

export default booksRouter;

```

Note that we don't use `/books` and `/books/:id` as paths but `/` and `/:id`.

---
#### Plugging in a router

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a> > <a href="#46">Routing</a> > <a href="#49">Routers</a>]

A router behaves like a middleware function, so you can simply plug it into your application with `app.use()`:

```js
// Import the books router from the routes directory
import booksRouter from "./routes/books.js";
app.use("/books", booksRouter);

```

Any request where the path starts with `/books` will be handled by that router,
with that path as a **prefix**:

<p class="center">
  <img src="images/routers.png" class="w80" />
</p>


???

The path passed to `app.use()` is **prepended to your router's paths**,
so your router's `/:id` route becomes `/books/:id` when plugged in like this.
It will handle HTTP requests to `/books/42`, for example.

---
#### What's it for?

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a> > <a href="#46">Routing</a> > <a href="#49">Routers</a>]

Imagine a more complex API where **comments** can be attached to **multiple other resources**:

.grid-50[

**Comments on books**

```
POST /books/:id`/comments`
GET /books/:id`/comments`
PATCH /books/:id`/comments/:cid`
DELETE /books/:id`/comments/:cid`
```


]
.grid-50[

**Comments on movies**

```
POST /movies/:id`/comments`
GET /movies/:id`/comments`
PATCH /movies/:id`/comments/:cid`
DELETE /movies/:id`/comments/:cid`
```


]
.container[

If you didn't have routers, you would have to define these 4 routes in **both** the **books' and movies' routers**:

```js
// In routes/books.js
booksRouter.`post("/:id/comments"`, /*...*/);
booksRouter.`get("/:id/comments"`, /*...*/);
booksRouter.`patch("/:id/comments/:cid"`, /*...*/);
booksRouter.`delete("/:id/comments/:cid"`, /*...*/);

// In routes/movies.js
moviesRouter.`post("/:id/comments"`, /*...*/);
moviesRouter.`get("/:id/comments"`, /*...*/);
moviesRouter.`patch("/:id/comments/:cid"`, /*...*/);
moviesRouter.`delete("/:id/comments/:cid"`, /*...*/);

```


]
---
#### Plugging routers on routers

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">Express</a> > <a href="#46">Routing</a> > <a href="#49">Routers</a>]

With a router, you could **define these sub-paths once**:

```js
// Create a comments router to attach comments to
// the parent found by the specified middleware
import express from "express";

export default function `makeCommentsRouter`(findParentMiddleware) {
  const commentsRouter = express.Router();
  commentsRouter.`post("/"`, findParentMiddleware /*...*/);
  commentsRouter.`get("/"`, findParentMiddleware /*...*/);
  commentsRouter.`patch("/:cid"`, findParentMiddleware /*...*/);
  commentsRouter.`delete("/:cid"`, findParentMiddleware /*...*/);
  return commentsRouter;
};
```

Then plug the whole URL sub-structure onto both the **books' and movies' routers**:

```js
// In routes/books.js
import makeCommentsRouter from "./comments.js";
booksRouter.`use("/books/:id/comments", makeCommentsRouter(findBook))`;

// In routes/movies.js
import makeCommentsRouter from "./comments.js";
moviesRouter.`use("/movies/:id/comments", makeCommentsRouter(findMovie))`;

```
