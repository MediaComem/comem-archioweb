# COMEM+ Web-Oriented Architecture Course

The goal of this course is to learn about the generic concept of **web
service**, focusing on **REST**ful APIs as one way to expose such a service. You
will:

* Learn the **core principles** of the REST architectural style.
* Learn how to **implement** a RESTful API in JavaScript with Node.js.
* **Deploy** your REST API on a cloud application platform.
* Add a **real-time** component to your REST API with WebSockets.

## Free theme

<!-- slide-column -->

You can design and implement your own web service idea,
as long as it meets the [evaluation criteria][eval].

Or you can choose one of the default projects that will be suggested.
